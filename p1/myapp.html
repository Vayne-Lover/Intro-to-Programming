				First
			</h4>
			<p>
				The world is not always as civilized as people might think. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are still those who would follow the blackest paths of magic and become corrupted by the darker powers that flow through Runeterra. Shauna Vayne knows this fact well.

				Second
			</h4>
			<p>
				As a young privileged girl in the heart of Demacia's elite, her father tried to convince her of the constabulary's ever-vigilant eye. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Young and naive, she truly believed that her world was one of perfect safety, until one night, when a twisted witch took interest in her father.

				Third
			</h4>
			<p>
				Vayne was able to take care of herself using her father's money, and she began to train as soon as an instructor would have her as a student. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time she was a fully grown woman, she had become a grim warrior. However, the fields of battle were not to be her home.

				Fourth
			</h4>
			<p>
				Not all shadows are to be feared. At least, if Vayne has her way.
